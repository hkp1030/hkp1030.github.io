  객체지향 설계와 알고리즘 기반 문제 해결 능력을 바탕으로 다양한 프로젝트를 성공적으로 이끌어왔습니다.

  특히 데이터베이스 설계에 뛰어난 역량을 보유하고 있으며, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL 등 다양한 데이터베이스를 활용하여 효율적인 데이터 관리 시스템을 구축할 수 있습니다.
  
  데이터베이스 모델링을 통해 데이터의 구조와 관계를 파악하여 최적의 데이터베이스 설계를 수행합니다. 또한, 인덱스 생성, 쿼리 튜닝 등의 작업을 통해 데이터베이스 성능을 최적화하여 시스템의 성능을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.
  
  지속적인 학습과 개발을 통해 새로운 기술 역량을 확장해 나가는 것을 목표로 하고 있습니다.
